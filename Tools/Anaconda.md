## Conda on Nanhu
Anaconda3 has been installed under `/opt/anaconda3/`. The default `base` environment has python 3.8 and some other scientific python packages distributed along with anaconda. If you want to customize your own python version / packages, we highly recommend creating an individual environment via the following instructions.

## Activate Conda
After your Nanhu account is created, the `base` conda environment should be activated automatically every time you log in.
